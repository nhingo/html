This repository contains html, CSS, and javascript files (some html files have javascript code) that I used to create and host my own website as part of the Holberton school's admission challenge, which provided requirements for the website that I needed to meet (flexbox layout, embedded tweets, javascript for changing image sizes on mouse click, etc.) In one week, I learned the syntax of html, CSS, and javascript, and wrote all the code from scratch (with some CSS styling provided by Holberton, some of which I overrode with my own). I also wrote the javascript code that enabled the quiz in the quiz.html file. The files can be viewed in any browser. I am working on finding a server to host the website and add more functionalities and content.
