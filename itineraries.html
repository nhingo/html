	<h1>Itineraries for travelling Japan</h1>
	<h2> Tips about the seasons</h2>
<p>	Full disclosure: as presented on the main page, I really think that Japan is beautiful to visit any time of the year, so there is no such thing as "when is the best time to visit Japan?"(the answer is: NOW). But if you are really, really concerned about seasons, here are a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spring: Consider going a week earlier than the season so you can avoid the price hike for the sakura season, and still catch the sakura for a few days, and save some money for other things (or go at the tail end of it). </li>

<li>Summer can be hot and humid - I personally think it's fine, but you can be uncomfortable if you plan to be outside (though it is much cooler in the mountains, always pleasant in the Northern prefectures, and in the South, going to the beach in the heat is awesome). It's mostly green in the summer, so not much variety in scenery, but the summer calendar is full of traditional and modern festivals, fireworks, and outdoor concerts, so it's still a great time to visit.</li>

<li> Fall: Hands down the best season to travel, but be prepared to pay the price!</li>

<li> Winter in Japan is mild (*disclaimer: I lived in New England for a long time), and while there is snow beyond Kyoto towards the North, it's not so uncomfortable that you can't travel (and there are great skiing resorts, if that's your thing). Around Christmas, every city has multiple big events for "light-up", which are light shows projected onto big buildings or landmarks, surrounded by trees covered in string lights. It's uncharacteristically envinromentally-unfriendly of Japan, but it also looks really dreamy and amazing. 

</ul>

<h2> The Itineraries </h2>
<p> Special note: If you have time, you should always, always add Kyoto to your itinerary (I try to focus on the type of traveler you are and leave out Kyoto for some), but as a long time Kyoto resident, I can vouch for it: it has everything you want in terms of local flavor, food, events, history, and even nature (though you do have to travel outside Kyoto a bit). </p>

	Looks like you're like me: you care more about eating than sightseeing, and prefer to walk local neighborhoods and join in local events than to go line up for hours at famous touristy spots. For you, I suggest spending time in Sapporo/Otaru, Tokyo, and Fukuoka (the cities are listed north-south). These are major cities with great food and charming neighborhoods, and of course lots of shopping and nightlife to enjoy (though Sapporo might be on the quiet side at night). Osaka is also fun for nightlife, but if you're already in Tokyo, you can skip Osaka. Fukuoka is a much more interesting, up-and-coming city (the new tech hub of Japan).

	Nature is prized and respected in Japan. Most of Hokkaido and Kyushu are still pretty unspoiled, even as they are popular destinations. Because these islands have mostly nature-related activities, while the destinations are popular, you can actually avoid big tourist groups if you drive to Furano, Shiretoko National Park, Noboribetsu (in Hokkaido) for the lavender fields, the majestic lakes, the drift ice, the bears, the volcanic  snow-topped mountains, and the hot springs. Talking about hot springs, you cannot miss Beppu and surrounding towns in Kyushu, famous for having many hot springs. Kyushu also has several national parks with volcanoes. The most famous (though without volcanoes) is Yakushima National Park, with its dreamy foggy forest, thousand year old cedar trees, and monkeys.

	In Japan, history is well preserved, despite multiple fires and wars and natural disasters the country has suffered. Temples and old houses (in the style of geisha tea houses, samurai houses, post town houses, or simply machiya - traditional old Japanese houses) are abundant in Kyoto, Nara, and Kanazawa, conveniently quite close to each other (Kyoto-Nara is about 30 minutes, while Kanazawa is a direct train 1 hour away).
