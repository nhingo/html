 <p> If you have ended up here somehow, chances are that you don't need much convincing that you should travel Japan (like a local...expat!). However, if you haven't made up your mind, consider:</p>

     <h2>Japan is interesting  no matter where you go</h2>
     
     <p>As a country, Japan has really paid attention to preserving and promoting their historic sights as well as their natural sceneries.</p>
    <p> The developed tourism industry makes it very easy to travel to different locations in the country, yet manages to avoid being touristy (no gimmicks to attract tourists, no aggressive peddling of merchandise).</p> 

    <h2>Japan is beautiful no matter when you go</h2>
    <p>97% of Japan (with the exception of Okinawa, the southernmost island, and some parts of Kyushu, the second-most south island) enjoys distinct 4 seasons, and each season has a major highlight that makes choosing when to go almost too easy and too hard at once.</p>

    <h3>Spring</h3>
<p>You have the ethereal cherry blossom trees lining the rivers and parks in full bloom (or you can wait till late spring and see lavender instead, if cherry is too "mainstream" for you).</p>

    <h3>Summer</h3>
    <p> Between July-September, you have fireworks and festivals almost every day of the week in every province, urban and rural.
    
    <h3> Fall</h3>
    <p> From late October to the end of November, the temples and mountains are coated in amazing shades of red, orange and yellow of the autumn maple leaves.</p>
    
    <h3>Winter</h3>
    <p> World-class ski resorts are hustling and bustling, but if that's not for you, you can always go to the Snow Festival in Hokkaido, the northernmost island, for fun, artistic ice scultures and amazing snow crabs.</p>

  <h2> Japan is fun no matter who you are</h2>
  <p> Japan is a country rich with culture and history, so no matter what your interests are, you will find something you can have fun with. Toys from famous anime series,tranquil temples that are hundreds of years old, crazy nightlife, cutting-edge modern art, overnight hikes to see the sunrise, easy hike around the park...you get the gist. 

    <h1 style="text-align:center">So now you want to travel Japan!</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align:center">On this website, I will show you:</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type:hiragana;text-align:justify">
 
 <li><a href="http://213.167.240.77/itineraries.html">Suggested itineraries (which include both where and when to go)</a>  </li>

 <li><a href="http://213.167.240.77/tips.html">Tips about culture, language, and general travel how-tos</a></li>

<li><a href="http://213.167.240.77/tweets.html">Curated updates from reliable travel-related sources</a></li>
 </ul>  

 <h2>But first, Know Thyself</h2>
 <p>I also planned the itineraries based on the types of travelers you are, so it works best if you know what you're like as a traveler. What kind of traveler are you?(click image for list)</p>

<p> That was just for laugh (although the list is very hilariously accurate!), and I have suggested a few matches between travel style and itineraries <a href="http://213.167.240.77/itineraries.html">here</a>.
